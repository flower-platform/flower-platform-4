# Project Description

Flex library.

Older version of FlexUtil project: Utility classes and UI components for Flex.

Many feature have been ported to the new FlexUtil project. However, a lot of logic still exists here, mainly using MX components, without being mobile friendly (e.g. Workbench framework).
