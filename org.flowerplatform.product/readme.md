# Project Description

General project that holds the product configuration. The product contains the Flower Platform plug-ins and minimal dependencies.

## Launch Configs

From ``flowerplatform.product``, run each time a plugin is added/removed, so that Eclipse/PDE can write the proper ``config.ini`` file.
