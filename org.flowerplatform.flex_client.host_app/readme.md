# Project Description

Flex application that acts as host for the Flex plugins.

## Launch Configs

### Flower Platform - Flex Client Host App (Web).launch

Launches the Flex debugger (if used with "Debug As"), by pointing to the URL corresponding to Flower Platform / Web.

### Flower Platform - Flex Debug without URL.launch

Launches the Flex debugger, and waits. We can start a Flex app, and the debugger will connect to it (i.e. the first one).
This is useful when we don't want to use the standard URL. E.g. an URL that contains a specific file to open.
